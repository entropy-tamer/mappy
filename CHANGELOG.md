### Breaking Changes

None. All changes are additive and backward compatible.

### Migration Guide

No migration required. The advanced quotient filter features are opt-in via the `advanced-quotient-filter` feature flag.

### Usage Examples

#### Rust Usage

```rust
// Enable advanced features
cargo run --features advanced-quotient-filter

// Use slot finding
let slot = maplet.find_slot_for_key("my_key").await;
let engine_slot = engine.find_slot_for_key("my_key").await;
```

#### Python Usage

```python
import mappy_python

# Create Maplet with advanced features
maplet = mappy_python.PyMaplet(capacity=1000, false_positive_rate=0.01)
maplet.insert("key", 42)
slot = maplet.find_slot_for_key("key")  # Returns slot index

# Create Engine with advanced features
config = mappy_python.PyEngineConfig(capacity=1000, false_positive_rate=0.01)
engine = mappy_python.PyEngine(config)
engine.set("key", b"value")
slot = engine.find_slot_for_key("key")  # Returns slot index
```
